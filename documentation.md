feat: Implement Mood Coordinate Mapping System

- Add MoodCoordinateMapper class for emotion mapping
- Integrate OpenRouter API for mood word generation
- Implement coordinate-based mood determination system
- Add error handling and input validation
- Include comprehensive documentation and usage examples

The system uses a 2D coordinate space (-100 to 100) to map emotions:
- X-axis: Emotional valence (negative to positive)
- Y-axis: Energy/arousal level (low to high)

Technical details:
- Uses OpenRouter API with Claude-3-Opus model
- Implements robust error handling and fallbacks
- Includes environment variable configuration for API keys
- Provides clear documentation and usage examples
```

## Project Overview
The Mood-Based Daily Journal project currently implements a sophisticated mood mapping system that converts numerical coordinates into meaningful emotional states. The system uses a two-dimensional coordinate space where:

- The X-axis represents emotional valence (ranging from -100 to +100)
- The Y-axis represents energy/arousal level (ranging from -100 to +100)

### Key Features
1. **Coordinate-Based Mood Mapping**
   - Precise emotional state determination based on x,y coordinates
   - Input validation to ensure coordinates are within valid ranges
   - Quadrant-based emotional categorization

2. **AI-Powered Mood Word Generation**
   - Integration with OpenRouter API
   - Uses Claude-3-Opus model for accurate emotional state description
   - Single-word response format for clarity

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive input validation
   - API error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Clear error messages and debugging information

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment variable support for API keys
   - Secure credential management
   - Easy configuration updates

### Usage
The system can be used by providing x,y coordinates within the -100 to 100 range:
```python
mood_mapper = MoodCoordinateMapper()
mood = mood_mapper.get_mood_from_coordinates(x, y)
```

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add mood history tracking
- [ ] Implement mood visualization
- [ ] Add support for multiple languages
- [ ] Include mood trend analysis
- [ ] Add user authentication and personalization
